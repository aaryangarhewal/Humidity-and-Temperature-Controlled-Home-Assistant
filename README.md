# Humidity-and-Temperature-Controlled-Home-Assistant
This project is all about to control the use of electrical appliances by sensing the Humidity and Temperature of the room. This will save electric power.
## Problem Statement
Today's world is affected by global warming due to which temperature is rising
which makes human lives uneasy , which results in use of more and more
electrical appliances like fans, cooler, A.c. and then there is a huge requirement
of power which humans are using irresponsibly which leads to wastage of
electricity.
## Proposed Solution
In this project , we are going to control the use of electrical appliances by
sensing the Humidity and Temperature of the room. This will save the electric
power.
### This smart home project has the following features:
1. Home appliances controlled from Mobile using Adafruit App
2. Home appliances controlled by temperature & Humidity sensor
automatically (In Auto Mode)
3. Monitor LIVE room temperature & Humidity reading on Smartphone
4. Control Home appliances through the Internet (WiFi).
## Required Components: -
### 1. ESP8266 :
The ESP8266 WiFi Module is a self-contained SOC with integrated TCP/IP protocol
stack that can give any microcontroller access to your WiFi network. The ESP8266 is
capable of either hosting an application or offloading all WiFi networking functions
from another application processor.
### 2. DHT11 Sensor :
The DHT11 is a basic, ultra low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. It
uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding
air, and spits out a digital signal on the data pin.
### 3. 2-Channel Relay :
2-Channel 5V Relay Module is a relay interface board, it can be controlled
directly by a wide range of microcontrollers such as Arduino, esp8266 etc. It uses
a low level triggered control signal (3.3-5VDC) to control the relay. Triggering the
relay operates the normally open or normally closed contacts.
* Relay Module; Model : JQC3F-C-S-10, 2 Channel
* Voltage to operate: 5V D
* Color : Blue Relays on a PCB
* Load : 10A, AC 250V/ 10A, 14V
### 4. 5v Adapter :
An adaptor is a special device for connecting electrical equipment to a power
supply, or for connecting different pieces of electrical or electronic equipment
together.
## Software Requirements :
1. Arduino IDE
2. Adafruit App
## Circuit -
## Applications :
* Industrial Automation
* Home Automation
* Electric Power can be saved using this project
